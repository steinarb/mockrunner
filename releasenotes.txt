mockrunner-0.3.6:

- Introduced new JCA test module (developed and donated to Mockrunner
  by Gábor Lipták). The framework can be used simulate backend systems that are 
  accessed through the use of the JCA Common Client Interface API. Check out
  the ConnectorTestModule and the corresponding examples in the 
  com.mockrunner.example.connector package.
- changed ActionTestModule.getActionMessages() and ActionTestModule.getActionErrors
  to return the union of request and session messages. Check out migratingfrom0.3.5.txt
- added prepareActionMapping to ActionMockObjectFactory to allow the use of custom
  ActionMapping subclasses. Modified LogoutActionTest to demonstrate the use of custom
  mappings. This feature relies on CGLib.
- added addExceptionHandler() to ActionTestModule. Can be used to simulate and test
  Struts ExceptionHandler. Please use the class DefaultExceptionHandlerConfig
- added resetAll() methods to web mock objects
- fixed bug 1253272 regarding setAttribute for null values
- fixed bug 1255832 reported by Lars Beuster (session invalidate)

  using public factory methods. This makes the mock object factories more extensible.
- JDBC test framework now supports generated keys using getGeneratedKeys()
- improved version of MockDatabaseMetaData, now supports pattern matching using
  "_" and "%" and case insensitive matching (contribution by Richard Emberson)
- applied patch 1230604 by David Stern, this fixes some issues with finding
  files in result set factories and introduces a template feature for FileResultSetFactory
- fixed bug regarding statement methods getMoreResults, getResultSet and getUpdateCount,
  getMoreResults now returns false since Mockrunner does not support multiple
  result sets and resets the current result set and update count, see patch 1223316
- fixed bug in MockResulSet, getBigDecimal(..., int scale) always returned null
- fixed bug 1296735 (verifyCallableStatementParameter and verifyPreparedStatementParameter
  null values)

  if necessary, preventing mock settings of being saved and restored later

  XML files (contribution by Jeremy Whitlock)

  which do not extend BaseTestCase
